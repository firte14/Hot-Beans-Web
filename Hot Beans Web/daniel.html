        <h1>Daniel Lecroy's Thoughts</h1>
        <p>I'm Daniel and probably not the typical designer positioned behind an Illustrator artboard adjusting pixels, but I design.
            Immersed in stylesheets tweaking font sizes and contemplating layouts is where you'll find me (~_^).
            I'm committed to creating fluent user experiences while staying fashionable.<br>
            In building JavaScript applications, I'm equipped with just the right tools, and can absolutely function independently
            of them to deliver fast, resilient solutions optimized for scale — performance and scalability are priorities on my radar.<br>
            I draw inspiration from a lot of different places when designing websites. Being a designer and creating something new every day is challenging.
            Sometimes, ideas spark instantly. But other times? They can take hours or even days to develop.
            When this happens, it’s useful to step away from the project for a moment and look to others’ work like at csszengarden to find inspiration.<br>
            I also draw inspiration and awe from cultural art from around the world both old and new.
